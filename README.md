# UFOs

## Project Overview
This project displays using JavaScript and HTML to provide a more in-depth analysis of the UFO sighting made by the users to filter out multiple criterias concurrently. Creating table fillers such as city, state, & more to help provide more information to analyze. The table is created using JavaScript, customized with HTML/CSS & Bootstrap

## Results
The webpage includes five filler search boxes on the left side of the page, which includes the Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. Entering the correct information in the filler search boxes will return the UFOs sightings. Index.html was edited to include state, city, country, and shape. The file app.js controls the whole event.

## Summary

### Drawbacks
- One drawback for the design is that you have to type the "Exact" information to get the results you need. Any spelling or capitlization errors will result in no or incorrect data.
### Improvment
- A drop down menu instead of free inputting data to minimize errors.
- Maybe include a calender pop out option to select the date to provide the correct format.
